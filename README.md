# Java Workshop

This repository contains lab materials to introduce first year computer science students to their
second formal language. The students are moving from C++ to Java so many of the comparisons are
references to differences in the languages. The purpose of the lab is to provide some insight in
techniques on how to begin learning how to develop in new languages on the fly.
